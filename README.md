# Amber color theme for Sublime Text

This is a Sublime Text-compatbile color scheme based upon my "Amber" theme described in [Monochrome Color Themes for Xcode](http://undefinedvalue.com/2015/02/01/monochrome-color-themes-xcode).

## Installation

To clone the repository to the location of Sublime Text packages, do the following:

    cd "~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages"
    git clone https://github.com/kristopherjohnson/AmberSublimeText.git Amber

Then, to enable the theme, choose *Sublime Text -> Preferences -> Color Scheme -> Amber -> Amber*.
